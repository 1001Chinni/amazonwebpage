<h2 style="color:gold"><u><em>Customer Obsession</u></h2>
<p style="color:white">Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and keep customer trust. Although leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.</p>
<h2 style="color:gold"><u>Ownership</u></h2>
<p style="color:white">Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for short-term results. They act on behalf of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”</p>
<h2 style="color:gold"><u>Are Right, A Lot</u></h2>
<p style="color:white">Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek diverse perspectives and work to disconfirm their beliefs.</p>
<h2 style="color:gold"><u>Hire and Develop the Best</u></h2>
<p style="color:white">Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize exceptional talent, and willingly move them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching others. We work on behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.</p>
<h2 style="color:gold"><u>Think Big</u></h2>
<p style="color:white">Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results. They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.</p>
<h2 style="color:gold"><u>Strive to be Earth’s Best Employer</u></h2>
<p style="color:white">Leaders work every day to create a safer, more productive, higher performing, more diverse, and more just work environment. They lead with empathy, have fun at work, and make it easy for others to have fun. Leaders ask themselves: Are my fellow employees growing? Are they empowered? Are they ready for what’s next? Leaders have a vision for and commitment to their employees’ personal success, whether that be at Amazon or elsewhere.</p>
